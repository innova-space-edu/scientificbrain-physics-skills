## Description
Assess when fluid, Hall/extended-MHD, hybrid-PIC, or full kinetic/PIC descriptions are credible using scale separation, collisionality, distribution-function and observable requirements.

## Use case
Use when ScientificBrain needs this capability as part of a reproducible computational-physics workflow.

## Known risks and mitigations
- Solver validity is regime- and observable-dependent; require explicit scale/closure checks.
- Solver APIs and input syntax change; inspect the live installed version.
- Expensive simulations require benchmark and reduced-size validation before scale-up.
- Never treat a successful run as physical validation.
